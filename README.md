# tex-conceal.vim
This is a fork of [tex-conceal.vim](https://github.com/KeitaNakamura/tex-conceal.vim) (adding my demands and adjustments) in order to keep up with Grouping and Conceals modified and appended by [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) (v2.8). 

## Note
(Since I am an amateur in Vim and VimTeX, this plugin is not sophisticated and well-organized.)
